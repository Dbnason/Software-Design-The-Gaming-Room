The Gaming room client wanted me to design a multiple platform application called "Draw it or Lose it".

I think my document updates and changes were really good. Also, I did a great job when figuring out what the client, The Gaming Room, needed in terms of technology and design constraints. But the best part was explaining the UML document and how it shows how everything works together. Doing this helped the client understand what they wanted for their software and make important decisions. Technical requirements can change or new ones can be added as the project goes on. I looked at the memo they gave us for details about the game. For example, the client wanted the game to work on both iOS and Android devices. To do this, I talked to the client and wrote down the technical requirements based on our conversation. Then, I documented the design constraints. Explaining the UML diagram was also important because it shows how the application will function, making it easier to start developing it.
